    title: "A Case of a Doctor Couple Bitten Severely by Their Pet Dog",
    info: ` Pets can transmit rabies, despite being vaccinated, mostly because
    the vaccination was ineffective due to a reason that is not known.
    This case describes the management of a doctor couple who were
    bitten by their vaccinated pet. The male was a known case of
    diabetes and hypertension, whereas the female doctor was bitten by
    a dog about six months ago. The couple was mainly managed by Anti
    Rabies Vaccine IM and Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG).`,

    info: ` Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is given not only for dog bites
    but also for scratches and licks on broken skin. An 18-year-old
    girl was scratched by her 2-year-old pet dog near her neck region.
    The wounds were deep, which lead to profuse bleeding. After the
    basic steps of cleaning with water and soap, the case was managed

    title: `A Case of 7 Years Old Girl Trying to Kiss an About 1-Year-Old Dog`,
    info: ` The wounds that are closer to the brain are more dangerous than
    others as the incubation period of vaccines becomes short; the
    children are at higher risk of having shorter incubation period. A
    7-year-old girl was bitten by her 1-year-old dog while trying to
    kiss her pet on the face. The dog bit the lower lip of the girl
    and caused bleeding. After cleaning the wound, some calculated
    dose of Human Rabies Immunoglobulin was infiltrated into &amp;
    around the wound, due to anatomical restrictions, and the
    remaining was injected through a deep intramuscular route.
    Anti-Rabies Vaccine was also given intramuscularly.`,

    info: ` Rabies can transmit when the bodily fluids of the animal come in
    contact with wounded region, broken skin or other organs like
    eyes. In a case, a dog’s saliva fell into the eye of an adult. The
    eye was washed with water; saline can also be used. The Human
    Rabies Immunoglobulin was instilled in the form of eye drops. This
    was followed by a full course of anti-rabies intramuscular

    in-coordination, change in mental status, and hyperactivity.
    Despite neurological and psychological interventions, the patient
    did not show any improvement in the condition. Upon collecting the
    detailed medical history, the patient revealed that he was bitten
    by a stray dog a month ago, and he did not seek any medical
    treatment for it. The patient was finally diagnosed as having Dumb
    (Paralytic) Rabies in its neurological stage. The patient died 4
    days later.`,

    title: `A Case of Category 3 Cat Scratch`,
    info: ` Although most importance is given in treating dog bites and
    scratches, scratches by cats should not be ignored; they should be
    treated in a similar way. An adult male was scratched by a cat
    while trying to save a pigeon from the cat’s attack. The scratch
    was on the dorsal side of his right hand, which caused bleeding.
    The wound was classified as category 3. The wound was managed with
    Human Rabies Immunoglobulin and Anti-Rabies vaccination.`,

    title: ` Case of a Child, 10 Years Old, Suffering from Jaundice`,
    info: ` There are several myths surrounding do’s and don’ts after a dog
    bite. Here we present a case where parents fell prey to a myth. A
    10-year-old child suffering from jaundice was bitten on left lower
    leg by a stray dog. The wound was classified as category 3 bite;
    however, whether the bite was provoked or unprovoked, it was not
    clear. Believing a myth, the parents bandaged the wound with red
    chilli powder, without even washing the wound. But washing the
    wound and rushing to the hospital and taking rabies vaccine should
    be encouraged.`,

    Patient`,
    info: ` A 42-year-old HIV positive male was bitten on the back side of his
    right leg. The wound was classified as category 3. The wound was
    washed thoroughly, and the patient was administered with Human
    Rabies Immunoglobulin. This was followed by Anti-Rabies
    Vaccination. Ten days after completing the vaccination course, the
    patient was referred to NCDC, Delhi for anti-rabies antibody
    estimation. Patient whose immunological memory is compromised,
    proper wound management, antisepsis, infiltration of rabies
    immunoglobulins and anti-rabies vaccination becomes extremely
    crucial.`,

    title: `A Case of a Vaccinated Pet Dog had Bit a 9 Years Old Boy`,
    info: `Vaccination of animals does not assure 100% protection against
    rabies. Animal vaccines may fail due to improper administration,
    poor quality, or poor health status of the animal. Also, one
    vaccine dose may not always provide long-lasting protection in
    dogs. This case describes the management of a 9-year-old boy who
    was bitten by his vaccinated pet dog. As for any dog bite, post
    exposure treatment with Human Rabies Immunoglobulin and
    anti-rabies vaccination was opted.`,

    post-mortem. The female was given full calculated dose of Human
    Rabies Immunoglobulin and a full course of Anti-Rabies
    Vaccination, given intramuscularly. This was given to prevent
    infection of the rabies virus. If the virus is present in the

    title: `A Case of 32 Years Old Bitten on Face, Neck and Left Upper Arm`,
    info: `A 32-year-old was bitten on the face, neck and left upper arm.
    These wounds were deep and required suturing. The attending
    surgeon cleaned and sutured the wounds and did the surgical
    dressing. But the dressing had to be cut, and Human Rabies
    Immunoglobulin had to be infiltrated. This was followed by
    Anti-Rabies Vaccine, which was given intramuscularly. Suturing of
    the bite increases the risk of inoculation of the virus deep into
    the wound. The wound should be suture after several hours to 3
    days after infiltration of Rabies Immunoglobulin.`,
